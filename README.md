# AutoReplant

AutoReplant is a very lightweight farming plugin. This plugin allows crops to be automatically replanted, as long as the player has seeds in their inventory of the type matching the crop they harvested.

This plugin is made for 1.16.4, and will be receiving continuous updates based upon what users would like from this plugin.

Currently no configurations, if there is a configuration you would like to have implemented please suggest it.
